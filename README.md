## FAQ

<sup>actually no one asked, but i assume you would</sup>

### I just see a blank page, how do I get started?

You can click the hidden button in the top left corner of the screen to open the configs.

If you are more experienced with JavaScript, you can also use the [developer console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_console).

The `help()` function should provide enough information to get you started.

### How do I share/import a preset?

You can import & export configs using the [developer console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_console).

Simply enter `importAllSettings(<preset>)`, but replace `<preset>` with the preset that was shared with you.
It should look something like this: `importAllSettings('{"widgets":[{"type":8,"options":{"value":"body{backdrop-filter:blur(3px) brightness(0.7)}"}}],"background":"no-repeat fixed 0% 0%/cover url(\\"img/bg/internet.jpg\\")"}')`

### What is the planned release date?

There is no planned release date yet, but it should release in early 2025.

This depends on how many features are requested and how many bugs are found.
